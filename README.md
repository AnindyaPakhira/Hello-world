# Hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.
Hello everyone, I am a Chemistry and Materials Science graduate student at TExas A&M University. I am really interested in learning new skills which is why I am crearting this GitHub repository. The main aim of this repository is to gain insights for collected data from laboratory experimentation, national lab experiments as well as DFT analysis. I would love everyone's insights about the the work I do, and love to hear your thoughts.
